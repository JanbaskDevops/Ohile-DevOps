We have 2 things in IT industry that are growing-

1) DevOps > Improment in system
2) Cloud > Purchaing things on rent

Example: 
1) Marriage suit
2) Laptop with windows-10 5yrs
     total number of hours in 5 yr: 43800 hrs
                        Actual use: 20000 hrs[wasting: 23800 hr]

* When we are purchaing the things we are paying upfront cost.

** Why to purchase when you can rent out? // Cloud computing

water purifier: 10000 INR
rent water purifier: 365 INR[Monthly bill]

What is cloud computing
========================
It's super store where you would be getting All the IT software's on rent.

Main purpose: Cost optmization.

We have 2 very improtant concept
1) Cloud computing[Azure Cloud, AWS]
2) DevOPs

Azure Cloud: https://portal.azure.com/#allservices[Create virtual machine in Azure]
Azure is having video tutorials and documentation to create services.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal?tabs=ubuntu


AWS cloud: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-one-create-ec2-resources.html


How many diffrent cloud providers we have?

IBM cloud- Lagecy Application/reserch
Oracle Cloud- Java/Database
Google Cloud- Seach based optimization
Azure Cloud- When you are using microsoft products[35%]
AWS cloud- It's very good for startup.

around 4000 provider

How to choose best cloud provider for me?  > Owner, Cost, Reliability, specilization
All these these cloud are having some specilization

1) Database[Oracle] > Java >Oracle cloud.
2) Windows from AWS/Azure
3) I want to create java based application

*** These days all cloud are equally important, we have concept of cloud native application design.

If my application is working fine on one cloud provider, it will work fine in other cloud provider also.

*** When you are using multiple cloud providers in your system then it's good approache.


All these cloud provider they have implemented their own devOps-

plain DevOps
AWS DevOps
Azure DevOps
IBM DevOps
GCP DevOps

You are getting advantage of DevOps and cloud both.


Lets say my requirement is I want to install java17 and git in ubuntu box

1) Without cloud: You would be having dependancy from Linux team, they will do this for you. and payment would be upfront.

2) With cloud: Here you would be just specifying what you need, they will do all for you, and you just need to pay as per your usage.


Requirement: I want to create linux box, and want to display  "Welcome to Linux"
               echo "Welcome to liux"

AzureDevOps and Azure Portal are two different things.

in Azure Portal we are creating the resources in cloud

in Azure DevOps we are impelmenting devOps practices.
https://dev.azure.com/d

How AzureDevOps and Azure cloud are releated?
=============================================
Azure DevOps is one of the services provided by azure cloud.

Azure DevOps is a very popular cloud tool which act as a separate tool

How to link between azure DevOps/ Azure cloud
==============================================
- Service connection
- Token

Suscription:
============
Whenever we are using any cloud services we need to pay money to cloud provider.

How you would be doing the biling? 
- Pay as you go
- student
- Free trial

Agile principles:
================
We have two mathods for developing the software-
1) Traditional
      Plan[Out line of my requirement delivery] > code[requirement into codes] > Build[Adding business logic with non business logic] > Test > release[deployment of application into any environment other than production] > deploy[Deployment into production] > operate > Monitor [1 cycle process]

Drawback of this approache: Around 75% resource wasting


2) Agile: We are deviding our project into multiple parts, and we would be implementing them parallely.

There are 12 principles given by agile-

10% Done
90% remaining
