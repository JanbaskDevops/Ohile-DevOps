JB10401 DevOps 14th April, Class18, Jenkins
===========================================
> Installing Jenkins in AWS
===========================
Jenkins run in top of Java, so we need to install java first

Link for Jenkins download: https://www.jenkins.io/download/

What is Jenkins?
================
The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project. 


Task for automation?
====================
1) Everyday I want my dev environment to be shut down by 6 PM IST, and get it started nextday by 8 PM IST

2) I want to take back of my server everyday around 4 AM in the morning

In these senario, we would be running some linux job

In jenkins we have 2 types of Job-
1) Freestyle job > Here you would be getting multiple GUI options to configure the job
2) Pipeline job


Console Output:
===============
Whenever we are doing activity in jenkins, console output will display the logs

Master architecture or Distributed architecture
===============================================
My requirement is I want to add multiple server

Manage Jnekins> Nodes > add/remove node


Adding pluggin
==============
Managejenkins > Plugins > select the plugin and install it

Pipeline job
============
So in DevOps we have multiple phases-
Plan code build test release deploy operate monitor


pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Plan') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Code') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Release') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Operate') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Monitor') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Testing1') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Testing2') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}
