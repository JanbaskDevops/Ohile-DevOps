1) Platform
============
It's a place where you would be doing your operations.

When developer is writing the code they will write all the instruction that you need to follow to install/run the application.

Spring Petclinic is a Spring Boot application built using Maven or Gradle. You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 17 or newer):

git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar

You can then access the Petclinic at http://localhost:8080/.

In above case we need Linux, Java 17 and Above, GIT

How to get server with above requirement.

1.1) Datacenter: You are managing your own system.
         > I need ubuntu server with Java17 and GIT installed on it.

     Approval, Precurement request[4-5 days], Linux[Provisining] >>> 1 Week

1.2) Cloud: You can get in few minutes.

Casestudy1: My server can handle 3000 users, but suddently I can see 9000 users, what should I do?
Capacity: 3000
Requirement: 9000
Solution: Increase capacity to 6000

Casestudy: My server can handle 30000 users, but suddently I can see 9000 users, what should I do?
Solution: remove additional servers

# In the websites traffic is fluating, and we need to handle it, but it's very hard to handle it in datacenter.

Same situation in cloud we can handle in few seconds/[Minutes]

CastStudy2: Cost
Datacenter: High
Cloud: minimal

[Cost and Quality]

What is Cloud?
==============
Cloud provide rental based infrastucture.

1) Compute,
2) Storage,
3) Networking
4) Database

Additonal advantage is:
1) SIMPLE GUI
2) Documnetation

Example: AWS > https://docs.aws.amazon.com/

Cloud vs multicloud
====================
There are around 500+ cloud providers are present in the market with specialization-

1) IBM cloud: Very easy to work with lagecy application.
2) Google cloud: This is good to work with data.
3) Oracle cloud: Good to work with Java Application.
4) Azure: Good with enterprise application
5) AWS: good with enterprise application

Example: I have one application that uses AWS cloud for frontend, Azure for backend, and GCP for Data Engineering[Multi cloud application].


> How to manage infracture in multi cloud environment

Option1: Cloud native tools.[AWS cli, azure CLI, Google CLI]
Option2: We can manage by console[but it's not recomeded approache]

One common soltion that work on all the cloud: Terraform

How?
====

My requirement is creating S3 in AWS, Storage account in Azure


How to write terraform code?
============================

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.43.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"

  tags = {
    Name        = "My bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
}

terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "3.97.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "storageaccountname"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"

  tags = {
    environment = "staging"
  }
}
}


1) Write a terraform code to create Azure Webapp[Linux] in Azure cloud?

2) Write a terraform code for creating S3 bucket in AWS

3) Write a terraform code for creating Ec2 machine in AWS

Lab for Terraform:
==================

Step1: Go to killerkoda > Playground > Ubuntu  [https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/ubuntu]

Step2: Go to terraform download [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install]


What do terraform do?
=====================
Terraform help us to create resources in cloud by script

What you know?
1) How to write script
2) How to install terraform


Next:
=====
1) How I can create resource in terraform?
2) Terraform commands
3) Terraform statefile and terraform architecture
4) Terraform module, backend and other important concept.


Homework?
=========

Azure
======
1) Create storage account in Azure by terraform?
2) Create AzureWebApp in Azure by terraform?
3) Create App service plan in Azure

AWS
====
1) Create VPC with 1 private and 1 prublic subnet
2) Create S3 Bucket
























































































2) Need of Cloud

3) Terraform and Packer and their need along with Golden Image
