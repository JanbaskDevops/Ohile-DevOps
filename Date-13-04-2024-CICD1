Sonarqube/Sonarcloud
Artifactory/Xray
GIT
Jenkins
Maven
Testing

> CICD is a heart of DevOps.

> As a part of Application deployment, we are deploying same application into multiple environment. so same process is getting duplicated.

> Our goal is to improve the process.

Application deployment instruction
===================================
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar

You can then access the Petclinic at http://localhost:8080/.

Here, as a part of first 3 steps one jar file created

1) Artifactory:
===============
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
# These commands Appox take 6-7 minutes

It's basically a place where we can store/update/retrieve and delete our packages.


2) SonarCloud
==============
When developer is writing the code, he might miss things as per standard[Static code analysis]


What all we cover in sonarcloud:
================================
1) Security

Example: Usermail: ohile@gmail.com
         Userpassword: Ohile@321


2) duplication(<3%)#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  char op;
  double first, second;
  printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): ");
  scanf("%c", &op);
  printf("Enter two operands: ");
  scanf("%lf %lf", &first, &second);

  switch (op) {
    case '+':
      printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf", first, second, first + second);
      break;
    case '-':
      printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf", first, second, first - second);
      break;
    case '*':
      printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf", first, second, first * second);
      break;
    case '/':
      printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf", first, second, first / second);
      break;
    // operator doesn't match any case constant
    default:
      printf("Error! operator is not correct");
  }

  return 0;
}

Duplication is 0

int main() {

  char op;
  double first, second;
  printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): ");
  scanf("%c", &op);
  printf("Enter two operands: ");
  scanf("%lf %lf", &first, &second);

  switch (op) {
    case '+':
      printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf", first, second,);
      break;
    case '-':
      printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf", first, second,);
      break;
    case '*':
      printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf", first, second,);
      break;
    case '/':
      printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf", first, second,);
      break;
    // operator doesn't match any case constant
    default:
      printf("Error! operator is not correct");
  }

  return 0;
}

Totalline: 40
Duplicate line: 4

Duplication percentage: 10%


3) Xray
=======

It's a security scan tool

Lets say, I have created dockerized application, so I would be having 3 layer-

1) Operating system
2) Docker
3) Application

Xray perform security scan in layered manner.

Scan1 for Operating system
SCan2 for Docker
Scan3 for Application


CICD
====
CICD is a group of activity performed for a particular purpose.

CICD tools: Jenkins


What is Jenkins?
================

The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project

Teams
-----
1) Automation: So, instead of manual we can select automation where it will do all the needful work

2) plugin:sonarcloud, Xray, artifactory

Jenkins installation
====================
Link: https://www.jenkins.io/download/

Most of the devops software are having version in below format
<Major-relese><minor-relese><fixpack>

1.[1-4].[1-12]

LTS: 3 Months release
Weekly release: Everyweek

Jenkins installation:
====================
1) Create a linux machine by AWS

Link> https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/


















































































































Once we run above 3 steps we would be getting one jar file that we can use of deployment
