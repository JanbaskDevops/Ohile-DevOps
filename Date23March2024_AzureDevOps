Link for Azure cloud: https://portal.azure.com/#home

In azure cloud we are creating the infrastucture, and with the help of Azure devops pipeline we are accessing that infrascture.

Subscription: it's a mathod used for bill to use cloud resources.

Creating infrastucture: This is the basically part of cloud/Linux team. Even we can also do this, that we will see in terraform later session.

What is Azure Pipeline, and why we need them?
=============================================
Azure pipelines are step by step implementation of SDLC.

SDLC: Plan code Build Test release Deploy Operate and Monitor

Step1: Understanding and creating organisation?
===============================================

Oraganisation# It's Name given to agreement between two parties to implement devops.

Oranisation > Projects[which follow SDLC implementation]

Note1: Within organisation we can have multiple project.
Note2: Default project is private project

When we are creating project project we can see 5 icons-
1) Repository
2) Board
3) Pipeline
4) Artifact
5) Test Board

# With the of above 5 services we can implement the devops[Azure Devops]

Repository
==========
Repository is a place where we can store our file[central location]







Key Point
=========
1) Organisation > Project[Linux, DevOps and Cloud] > Teams[We can invite the people]
2) We can create multiple teams as per our project infractucture
Oraganisation > Oraganisation name > project > project name > project setting > teams > creating the team
3) How these team are communication with each other[Ticketing tool, called azure board]
Example: I am from testing team and I want to create issue with Development Team

Azure Board:
===========
It's ticketing tool/tool to track the activity.

Sprint: It's basically timeline defined by a project.
Backlog: What functionity we want to implement.


Sprint1:
I want to create calculator
Task1> Developement team to develop calcultor [Assigned to Development team]
Task2> Tesing team to test calculator [Assigned to Testing team]
Task3> Packing team to package calculator [Assigned to packing team]
Task4> Validation team to validate calcultor [Assigned to validation team]

Task: Some requirement that needs to be fulfilled.
Issue: During the task if we face any issue then we will open ticket to concern team
EPIC: Collection of task related to particular activity[Epic name is Calculator]
Support:
UserStory
Bug
Test
Artifact

What if I want to get additonal oprions other than above?
Basic, Agile, CMMI and Scrum


How to select the workflow? and who would be seleting the workflow
==================================================================
Artitect or technical manager needs to take call.

Task1: 
Create organisation with name Janbask.
Create a project with name DevOps.
Create 6 Team[Dev, Test, QA, Client, internal and Project manager]
Select the Basic, CMMI, Scrum and Agile Process and list down the different ticketing stategy.

Repository
==========
It's a central place where we would storing our data.

Create new repository
Import repository
Manage repository

My requirement is I want to deploy my application[spring pet clinic] into server with 5 GB RAM, and 1000 HDD and 4 CPU.

Agent
=====
Pool: Group of server with some desinated capacity
Poolwith4CPU1000HDD4RAM

1) Create a pool with desirename
2) Find the agent command[When I am clicking on new agent]

By default microsoft also provide some pool with default capacity[2CPU and 8RAM]

Task:
=====
I want to run my application with server 1000GBHDD4CPU16RAM and I want to user Azure DevOps process, and my source code is springpetclinic

> Create account in Azure DevOps
> Create account in Azure portal
> Create resource in Azure Portal with desire capacity
> Link Azure Portal and Azure devops by Agent
> Run the pipeline to achive the desire things.


Pipeline
=========
When Developer is writing the code for any project, he will give you steps how you can run the project.

Spring Petclinic is a Spring Boot application built using Maven or Gradle. You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 17 or newer):

git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar

You can then access the Petclinic at http://localhost:8080/.

Now This process involve some tools and steps those things in combine called pipeline

Pipeline: Step by Step execution of software development lifecycle steps

Types of Pipeline
================
1) Build Pipeline
2) Release pipeline
3) Deploy pipeline

Build Pipeline:
==============
So in any project we have 2 things-
1) Business logic > Calculator[Java program for calculator]
2) Presentation logic [Screen of battery of calculator]

Combining business logic with presntation logic is known as build pipeline.


In IT inductry we have multiple environment to do the activity like-
1) Development, 2) Test, 3) Preprod, 4) Prodution, 5) Staggimg

When we will be deploying code to any environment like except production is known as release pipeline.

When we will deploy code into production is known deploy pipeline.

Artifact
========
Suppose, I have 5 environment, and I have created 5 different pipeline. in all the pipeline steps would be almost same.


git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar


WORA: write once run anywhere.

Example: Create account into google and send test email to umesh@janbask.com repeat this for 30 days.


Tomorrow:
1) Ansible,
2) Monitoring
3) SRE
4) Certificate
