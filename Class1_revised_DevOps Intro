DevOps Tools:
==============
DevOps taslk about improvment, but we can achive improvement with the help of DevOps tools-
Docker, Kubernetes, terraform, packer, maven, GIT, Jenkins, AzureDevOps, JIRA, Sonarcloud, Artifactory, Security Scan[DAST/SAST], Ansible....

Where I can practice?

What is DevOps tools and how they help us?
=========================================
Let say my developer has written code for Juice shop

Link: https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop

I just want to know if their is any security vurnability[Secuity issue]

Vurnabilty: It's is peace of code that causes security issue is known as vurnability.

Step1: git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop

[SAST tool link] https://github.com/ZupIT/horusec
Step2: apt-get update ; apt install jq

Step3: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZupIT/horusec/master/deployments/scripts/install.sh | bash -s latest
       horusec version

Step4: horusec start -D -e="true" -p ./

Prequestis:

3) Whenever you see a new team or command take chatgpt help to build your understanding.
4) Please use standard document.



What you need to make your understanding?
=========================================
You need build your basics, then you need to focus on document reading.

My architect is asking me to implement alidns by terraform


variable "name" {
  default = "tf_example"
}
variable "domain_name" {
  default = "alicloud-provider.com"
}
data "alicloud_resource_manager_resource_groups" "default" {}
resource "alicloud_cms_alarm_contact_group" "default" {
  alarm_contact_group_name = var.name
}

resource "alicloud_alidns_gtm_instance" "default" {
  instance_name           = var.name
  payment_type            = "Subscription"
  period                  = 1
  renewal_status          = "ManualRenewal"
  package_edition         = "standard"
  health_check_task_count = 100
  sms_notification_count  = 1000
  public_cname_mode       = "SYSTEM_ASSIGN"
  ttl                     = 60
  cname_type              = "PUBLIC"
  resource_group_id       = data.alicloud_resource_manager_resource_groups.default.groups.0.id
  alert_group             = [alicloud_cms_alarm_contact_group.default.alarm_contact_group_name]
  public_user_domain_name = var.domain_name
  alert_config {
    sms_notice      = true
    notice_type     = "ADDR_ALERT"
    email_notice    = true
    dingtalk_notice = true
  }
}

resource "alicloud_alidns_address_pool" "default" {
  address_pool_name = var.name
  instance_id       = alicloud_alidns_gtm_instance.default.id
  lba_strategy      = "RATIO"
  type              = "IPV4"
  address {
    attribute_info = <<EOF
    {
      "lineCodeRectifyType": "RECTIFIED",
      "lineCodes": ["os_namerica_us"]
    }
    EOF
    remark         = "address_remark"
    address        = "1.1.1.1"
    mode           = "SMART"
    lba_weight     = 1
  }
}


Please explain below command to me
apt-get update ; apt install jq



DevOps Actual picture and it need?
===================================

In DevOps we have 2 teams-

1) Development team[Dev Team]
============================
Task1: Think for the steps how to elephant.
1) Developer is working on some idea which is never implemented[ATM], so he is doing so many experiment/changes.

2) Developer think for 20 yrs ahead.


2) Operation team[Ops Team]
===========================
They have fixed schedule/sctivity that we need to follow.

They want you to follow the policy/process without fail

There would be alway a communication gap betwwen development and Operation.

Senario:
========
CitiBank, a/c balance 25000$, you balance is showing -4000$ after depositing 15000$[Expected: 40000$, EMI to pay].

customer support[raise ticket for a problem]


int/long balance, deposite[0 to 65535> 65536 > 0] // 
balance= balance + deposite

Planet: Earth
Planet: Jupitor

Devs are from Venus. Ops are from Mars
[These people even dont try to understand each other]



Why DevOps started?
===================

Patrick debois was working on project where he feel there is so much problem because of Develpment and Operation teams thinking, and he wanted to sortout that.


He called one meeting. subject: #DevOpsDay

Mom:
1) Development team will respect Ops Team as senior citizen

2) Ops Team will respect Develepement team.

3) Process should be same for all.[Developement, Test, Preprod, prod....]

4) Automation.[Avoiding manual work]

5) Improvement.


Depending on above 5 principle we have set of DevOps tool.
